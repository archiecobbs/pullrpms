.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates (or adds to) an rpm-md RPM repository using the transitive closure of the RPMs and/or RPM requirements
specified on the command line.
The repository is created in the directory
.Ar targetdir .
.Pp
The repositories that
.Nm
pulls from are those defined by the
.Pa *.repo
files in the first directory found among (in order of precedence):
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It o
The
.Ar reposdir
specified with the
.Fl d
flag;
.It o
An existing
.Pa @REPOSDIR@
subdirectory of
.Ar targetdir ; or
.It o
.Pa /etc/zypp/repos.d .
.El
.Pp
In any case, when
.Nm
completes, the
.Pa @REPOSDIR@
subdirectory
of
.Ar targetdir
will contain the chosen repo files, thus serving as the default choices for next time.
.Pp
.Nm
caches upstream repository meta-data and resolution state.
.Nm
will not redundantly download RPMs already resolved by a previous invocation.
Together these optimizations make regeneration after minor changes proceed relatively quickly.
.Pp
You use the
.Fl \-linkin
and
.Fl \-linkout
flags to copy (hard link) RPMs into the repository prior to resolution, or out of the repository after resolution (respectively).
In other words, the
.Fl \-linkin
flag pre-seeds the repository from a directory previously created (or updated) with the
.Fl \-linkout
flag.
This allows multiple repositories to be created based on an initial shared set of RPMs,
or to share a common RPM cache, eliminating redundant downloads.
.Pp
.Nm
is relies on the
.Xr zypper 8
and
.Xr createrepo 8
utilities.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Specify the preferred architecture.
This flag is needed when constructing a repository for a machine whose architecture
differs from that of the local machine.
.It Fl d
Specify a new repository set to pull from.
The
.Ar reposdir
parameter is a directory from which to copy
.Pa *.repo
repository files.
Any existing files in the
.Pa @REPOSDIR@
subdirectory of
.Ar targetdir
will be removed first.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
flag may be repeated to combine the content of multiple directories.
.It Fl \-linkin
Prior to resolution, copy in the RPMs from
.Ar dir
into the repository using hard links.
The directory
.Ar dir
should have been populated by a previous invocation, using the
.Fl \-linkout
flag.
.It Fl \-linkout
After resolution, copy out all of the RPMs in the repository into
.Ar dir
using hard links.
The directory
.Ar dir
will be created if needed.
Existing RPMs in
.Ar dir
will remain undisturbed.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
.El
.Sh FILES

.It Pa targetdir/repodata
Generated repository meta-data
.It Pa targetdir/@CACHEDIR@
Cached meta-data for optimizing
.Pa repoddata
rebuild time
